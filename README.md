## Overview

**Gradient** is a crowdsourced street-parking finder built for iOS. Predictions on parking availability are shown through color-highlighted streets on the map, and drivers help each other by rating the availabillity. It is based on the city of Seattle's civic parking records and supported by real-time user feedback to provide reliable, dynamic predictions on parking.

It was designed and built as part of the 2017 senior capstone for Informatics at the University of Washington, Seattle.

**NOTE: This is a proof-of-concept application and there are still parts that are not completely functional. As of June 2017, our capstone has ended and we do not plan to further build out the functionality.**
