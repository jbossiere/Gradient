## Overview

**Gradient** is a crowdsourced street-parking finder built for iOS. It is based on data collected from the city of Seattle's parking meters, and bolstered by parking ratings from users.

It is being designed and built as part of the 2017 senior capstone for Informatics at the University of Washington, Seattle.
